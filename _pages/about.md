# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), advised by Prof. [Hossein Azizpour](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=t6CRgJsAAAAJ&hl=en), Prof. [Andrea Nascetti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mdq6_jQAAAAJ&hl=en), and Prof. [Josephine Sullivan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=REbc02cAAAAJ&hl=en). 

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, temporal modeling and uncertainty estimation, as well as their applications in satellite imagery and biomedical scenarios.

* I also worked closely with Prof. [Takeo Igarashi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2LJJtI8AAAAJ&hl=en), M.D. [Taichi Kin](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/people003717.html) and Prof. [Xi Yang](https://keepthinkingyx.github.io/Xi-Yang/) at [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) on the project of 3D reconstruction and medical image processing.

* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). My undergraduate research supervisor is Prof. [Chuan Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuan-Zhang-6).
